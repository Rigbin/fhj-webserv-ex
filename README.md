# Webserver Exercise - MSD19 SS21

In this exercise, we will configure two popular webserver. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/) and [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/).

> Please use our [prepared virtual machine](https://elearning.fh-joanneum.at/course/view.php?id=2550#section-5) for this exercise!

For this purpose we have prepared a series of configuration examples for you, which build on each other. You should be able to solve these independently based on your previous knowledge from past semesters. 

Should you not be able to solve the problem on your own, we will of course be at your side via MS Teams during the practice period. If you have questions about this exercise at a later time, please contact us via mail or MS Teams.

You are basically free to choose the order in which you carry out the exercises. Our plan would be Apache first and then Nginx. Finally the combined exercise, which includes both servers.

The exercises also contain some *optional* parts, which are primarily intended for those who can quickly get through the guided parts.

> Before you begin, make sure you are [prepared](./sections/00_prerequisites.md), so that you can easily access the configured web pages with your browser!
